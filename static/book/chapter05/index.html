<h2 id="ch-design-center">The CFEngine Design Center</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://cfengine.com/cfengine-design-center">CFEngine Design Center</a> is a repository of pre-made, ready-to-use components called sketches that allow entirely data-driven system management. You can install, configure, and deploy sketches across your infrastructure without modifying or even looking at the code used to implement them. Sketches may range in complexity from simple system-configuration tasks (e.g., configuring the system timezone) to complex, multi-host operations (e.g., coordinating and managing cloud instances in Amazon EC2).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may wonder what the difference is between the CFEngine Design Center and the CFEngine Standard Library. The latter contains reusable but low-level building blocks that you use on your own policies to perform certain common tasks. Most bundles and bodies in the Standard Library have very limited scope and functionality: editing or copying files, defining classes, etc. By contrast, the Design Center contains more encompassing components that perform complete tasks that can stand on their own, such as configuring DNS, setting up the system timezone, installing MySQL, or managing EC2 virtual machines. Most Design Center sketches use the Standard Library in their code, just like any other policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Design Center also provides tools for managing and creating sketches, and a framework for encapsulating your own policies, for your own use or to share with the community. The Design Center is a community project <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/">hosted on GitHub</a>, so you are encouraged to use it and contribute to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we will describe the basic concepts behind the CFEngine Design Center, and how to make use of it both as a user and as a contributor.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_getting_started_with_the_design_center">Getting Started with the Design Center</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start getting familiarized with the workflow and capabilities of the Design Center tools, we will perform a task we did earlier: configuring the SSH daemon like we did in <a href="#editing-etcsshd_config">[editing-etcsshd_config]</a>, but this time using a Design Center sketch. Later we will explain in detail the concepts behind the Design Center functionality.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_installing_cf_sketch">Installing cf-sketch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of this writing, the best way to install cf-sketch is to fetch it directly from the design-center repository hosted on <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/">GitHub</a>. Inside the repository, cf-sketch can be found under <em>tools/cf-sketch/</em>.</p>

<p>Before running cf-sketch.pl, you should install the Term::ReadLine::Gnu Perl module, for a nicer interactive-prompt experience. Depending on your operating system, it may be available as a package. For example, on Ubuntu 12.04 you can simply run this command to install it:</p>
</div>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting"># <strong><code>apt-get -y install libterm-readline-gnu-perl</code></strong></pre>

<p>You can have the same sketch running with different parameters on different machines, or even on the same machine but under different conditions. To differentiate them, you define <em>environments</em>, which use CFEngine class expressions to define groups of machines. For our example, we want the SSH parameters we just defined to be applied on all Linux machines, so we will create an environment that contains all the Linux machines:</p>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting">cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>define environment</code></strong>

Please enter a name for the new environment: <strong><code>linux_machines</code></strong>
I will now prompt you for the conditions for activation, test, and
verbose mode that will be associated with environment
'linux_machines'. Please enter them as CFEngine class expressions.
Please enter the activation condition: <strong><code>linux</code></strong>
Please enter the test condition: !any
Please enter the verbose condition: !any
Environment 'linux_machines' successfully defined.

cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>list -v env</code></strong>

The following environments are defined:

linux_machines
  [activated]: linux
  [test]: !any
  [verbose]: !any</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We define a new environment called linux_machines, which has its activation condition set to linux. This gets interpreted as a CFEngine class expression, which means that the linux_machines environment will be active on all the Linux machines. Environments also define conditions for when to activate test and verbose modes (these have to be explicitly supported by the sketch, and not all of them do), which by default are always disabled through the !any class expression.</p>

<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conditions in an environment are arbitrary CFEngine class expressions! This means that you can have them depend on arbitrary conditions, both static (e.g. operating system, Linux distribution, architecture, etc.) and dynamic (e.g. time of day, day of the week, CPU load, etc.)—basically anything that can be differentiated through a CFEngine class. If you need a refresher on class expressions, please see <a href="#classes-and-decision-making">[classes-and-decision-making]</a>.</p>
</div>

</table>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having defined the parameters you want to use and the environment in which you want to use them, you need to <em>activate</em> the sketch. Activation connects a sketch with a parameter set and an environment. For our example, what we want can be summarized as, “I want to activate the Security::SSH sketch using the parameter set sshd_base_config in all my Linux machines”. We use the activate command:</p>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting">cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>activate Security::SSH sshd_base_config linux_machines</code></strong>

Using generated activation ID 'Security::SSH-1'.
Using existing parameter definition 'sshd_base_config'.
Using existing environment 'linux_machines'.
Activating sketch Security::SSH with parameters sshd_base_config.

cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>list activations</code></strong>

The following activations are defined:

Activation ID Security::SSH-1
  Sketch: Security::SSH
  Parameter sets: [ sshd_base_config ]
  Environment:  'linux_machines'</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that you can activate the same sketch using different parameter sets on different environments, which would allow you, for example, to have different SSH configurations for Linux and Solaris machines, for machines that belong in your DMZ versus hosts in your internal VLAN, or during workdays and during the weekend. The possibilities are limited only by what you can express as CFEngine class expressions in the activation condition for each environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Activations also have a name. By default the activate command generates a name automatically, as shown in this example (the generated name is Security::SSH-1). If you want to explicitly name an activation, you can do so by passing the -n option to the activate command.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remaining step is to actually execute the sketches. You can do so using the run command:</p>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting">cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>run</code></strong>

Runfile /var/cfengine/masterfiles/cf-sketch-runfile-standalone.cf
successfully generated.
Now executing the runfile with:
/usr/local/sbin/cf-agent \
  -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/cf-sketch-runfile-standalone.cf</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Executing the sketches implies generating a runfile, which is a CFEngine policy file that contains all the necessary information and code. Once this file is generated, cf-sketch executes it with cf-agent. After execution finishes, you can inspect the <em>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</em> file to verify that the Protocol, UseDNS, and X11Forwarding parameters have been set to the correct values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The run command performs a one-time execution of the currently-activated sketches, and is useful for testing your sketch activations while configuring them. For actual deployment of your sketches, you do not want to run them by hand all the time, but integrate them into the regular execution of CFEngine. For this, use the deploy command:</p>
</div>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting">cf-sketch&gt; <strong><code>deploy</code></strong>

Runfile /var/cfengine/inputs/cf-sketch-runfile.cf
successfully generated.</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this generates the runfile (with a different filename from the earlier one, to indicate it is not meant to be run standalone), but does not execute it. For this to happen, you need to integrate it into your <em>/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf</em> file. As of this writing, you need to make the following changes. You need to do this just once, the first time you deploy a Design Center runfile.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Remove the line from the <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/inputs">inputs</a> attribute that loads @(cfengine_stdlib.inputs) (on 3.5.1 and later) or “libraries/cfengine_stdlib.cf” (on 3.5.0 and older).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following line after the line that loads “cf-sketch-runfile.cf”:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>@(cfsketch_g.inputs),</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can verify your <em>promises.cf</em> file with the following command. If there is no output, the file is correct:</p>
</div>
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting"># <strong><code>cf-promises -f /var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf</code></strong></pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, every time cf-agent runs, it will automatically load and execute the activated sketches. If you make any changes in the sketch installations or configuration, simply run the deploy command again, and your changes will be picked up automatically.</p>

<p>If you run cf-sketch on the policy hub, all the files (installed sketches and runfile) are stored under <em>/var/cfengine/masterfiles/</em>, which means they will be automatically distributed to all the clients that get their policy updates from the hub. Note that this doesn&#8217;t mean that all the sketches will be executed in all the clients! This depends on how the sketches are activated, in particular the environment with which each sketch and parameter set is activated. In our earlier example, the Security::SSH sketch will be executed with the parameters contained in the sshd_base_config parameter set <em>only</em> on Linux machines, according to the environment with which it was activated.</p>

          <p>This file has a <code>body common control</code>
          definition because it is designed to be run by itself (hence the
          “standalone” in the filename). It calls two bundles:
          <code>cfsketch_g</code>, which defines some common variables,
          and <code>cfsketch_run</code>, which invokes all the activated
          sketches. Note that the <code>inputs</code> definition is
          taken from the cfsketch_g.inputs variable, which
          contains all the files that need to be loaded for the currently
          activated sketches.</p>

          <em class="filename">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/cf-sketch-runfile.cf</em>,
          generated by the <code>deploy</code> command, you will see that
          the only difference is the absence of the <code>body common

<h3 id="_contributing_to_the_design_center">Contributing to the Design Center</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you know how to use the Design Center to install, configure, and deploy sketches. With this you are able to use any of the sketches available in the Design Center repository. But at some point you may want to write your own! We will now look at how to create your own sketches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you have written a very useful piece of CFEngine policy, and you would like to share it with the world, or at least with your colleagues, so that they can all benefit from it. How do you go about it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The foundation of any Design Center sketch should be a working piece of CFEngine policy, in the form of a bundle of type <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/agent">agent</a> that performs the appropriate functionality. This bundle can call other bundles or bodies as appropriate, but it should be callable as a single point of entry. At least until you become more familiar with how sketches are structured, I would advise you to write your bundles first as regular CFEngine policy, and then convert them to sketches. This is what we will do in this section. As an example, we will use the password_expiration() bundle that we developed in <a href="#password-expiration-periods">[password-expiration-periods]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step is to define a name for our new sketch. We can use arbitrary names, but the Design Center by convention encourages us to use names of the form <em>Category::Sketch</em>, or even <em>Category::Subcategory::Sketch</em>. For our password-expiration configuration sketch, we will use Security::password_expiration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now need to define the interface for the sketch. In our original example, all the parameters are specified as variables inside the password_expiration() bundle, but for a sketch, we want those values as parameters specified by the user when they configure the sketch. Let us look through the original code, make a list of what those configurable parameters should be, and decide on their names while we are at it:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">pass_max_days</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum password age in days.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">pass_min_days</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum password age, also in days.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">pass_warn_age</dt>
<dd>
<p>The warning period before a password expires, in days.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">min_uid</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum UID for setting password-expiration parameters. Users with UID below this threshold will not be modified.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">skipped_users</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma-separated list of usernames to skip when setting password-expiration parameters.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">skipped_uids</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma-separated list of UIDs to skip when setting password-expiration parameters.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these can be specified as strings, just as they were in the original policy code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also need to decide on a <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/namespace"><em>namespace</em></a> in which to place the sketch. I suggest using a namespace that contains a reference of the origin of the sketch (for example, all CFEngine-produced sketches have namespaces that start with cfdc_ for “CFEngine Design Center”), and also the name of the sketch (or a shortened, representative version of it). We will use cflearn_password_expiration.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Namespaces are top-level naming divisions that help avoid conflicts in bundle, body or class names. Please refer to <a href="#namespaces">[namespaces]</a> for background.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we have this information, we can rewrite our policy file a bit to make it ready to use as a sketch. Here is the updated code, with some comments about the changes we made (as you go through these, please compare them to the original code in <a href="#password-expiration-periods">[password-expiration-periods]</a>):</p>

        <p>We have added a class expression to limit the execution of the

        a sketch might be activated on many different systems, and it needs to
        make sure to do the right thing regardless of where it is running. In

You can find the full specification in the <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/blob/master/howto/etch_a_sketch.md">“Writing a Design Center Sketch” guide</a>, but you can also use the sketchify command of cf-sketch to do it automatically. sketchify reads the policy file, asks you for the appropriate information, and produces a ready-to-use sketch in your local checkout of the Design Center repository. This is what we will use now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sketchify command takes as its only argument the file containing our policy file, which it reads and analyzes for bundles of type <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/agent">agent</a>. In our case there is only one such bundle, so it is used automatically as the entry point for the sketch (if more than one agent bundle is found, you will be asked which one you want to use as the sketch entry point).</p>

<p>In addition to the parameters defined in the API, a sketch entry bundle can receive two special parameters of type environment and metadata. If used, these parameters will be automatically generated and passed by the Design Center framework when executing the sketch.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The environment parameter contains the name of the environment with which the sketch has been activated. This allows the sketch to access the characteristics of the environment, including the verbose and testing fields (interpreted as classes, so that the sketch can easily use them as conditions to alter its behavior).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The metadata parameter contains the name of an array in which the Design Center framework automatically stores all the sketch metadata, including its name and description, authors, etc.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these parameters are not already passed to the entry bundle in the input file, sketchify will ask you if you want to add them.</p>

<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="programlisting">The entry point 'password_expiration' doesn't seem to receive
parameters of type 'environment' or 'metadata'.  These arguments
are not necessary, but can be useful for the sketch to respond to
different run environment parameters (i.e. test or verbose mode)
or to have access to its own metadata.

I can automatically add these parameters to the bundle, together
with some code to put their information in classes and variables,
and also to create an activation_id variable that will make it
possible to use the new sketch with the CFEngine Enterprise
Design Center GUI.

Would you like me to do this? (Y/n) <strong><code>y</code></strong></pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to adding the parameters to the bundle, sketchify will also add some boilerplate code to do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extract the values of all fields defined in the active environment (at least activated, verbose and testing, and possibly others if defined) into both classes and variables. For example, it will create a string variable named verbose that contains the class expression stored in that field, and also a class named verbose that will be set to the result of evaluating that class expression. You can then use that class within your sketch to easily enable additional reports, when verbose mode has been activated in the current environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a string variable named activation_id that contains a unique identifier for the current sketch activation. Multiple activations of the same sketch will have different activation_id values, so you can use the IDs to differentiate among the activations. This is used mainly by the Enterprise GUI interface to the Design Center.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of this writing, this is the code that is automatically inserted by sketchify at the top of the bundle (code reformatted to fit on the page):</p>

<p>While sketchify automates most of the process of creating a sketch from an existing bundle, there are a few things that it doesn&#8217;t handle. You may want to take a look at the files it generates for sanity checking. Here are some of the things you may want or need to fix by hand:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dependencies: If your sketch depends on other sketches, you need to add them by hand to the depends metadata element in the generated sketch.json file. At the moment, sketchify automatically inserts a dependency on CFEngine 3.5.0, which is the minimum recommended version of using Design Center sketches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple entry points: The Design Center framework supports multiple entry points per sketch (to different bundles), this is not supported at the moment by sketchify, so you need to add any additional entry points by hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you create a useful sketch, why not contribute it to the community? After all, the Design Center will only get better as more people contribute to it. This is very easy to do by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">submitting the new sketch as a pull request</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center">design-center project at Github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_learning_more_about_the_design_center">Learning More About the Design Center</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we have touched only on the basics for using and contributing to the Design Center, but there is much more to explore! I invite you to review the <a href="https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/manuals-design-center.html">Design Center documentation</a> to learn more. We have mentioned sketches as the main type of content in the Design Center repository, but it also hosts other types of content:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>examples</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Contributed examples of CFEngine policy. These are not meant to be ready to use like sketches, or organized in any way, but rather to serve as starting points for others to write their own policies or to see how certain things can be achieved in CFEngine.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>tools</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Miscellaneous tools that have been contributed by the CFEngine community to help you work with CFEngine. It also contains cf-sketch, which manages sketches on a system.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a user, you interact with the Design Center mostly through tools like cf-sketch or the Design Center GUI in CFEngine Enterprise. But these tools do not directly manipulate sketches on the system—instead, these operations are done through the <em>Design Center API</em>, which performs all operations related to sketches, parameter sets, environments, validations, and deployment. The API is implemented through the cf-dc-api.pl program, which is part of the Design Center installation. You can find detailed information about the Design Center API and its operations in the <a href="http://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference-design-center-api.html">Design Center API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CFEngine Design Center is the easiest way of interfacing with CFEngine, allowing you to perform arbitrarily complex configurations without touching the CFEngine policy code. It is a project in active development, so by the time you try them, some things may have changed from the descriptions in this chapter. The Design Center depends on active contributions from the user community, so I encourage you to participate!</p>
