These are all the source files included in the book, organized by chapter. Note that in the text, many examples show only fragments of a larger file (for example, when things are explained step by step). In these cases, only the complete file is linked here, and only once per chapter.

Note that the [CFEngine Standard Library](https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles/tree/master/lib) is not included here, despite several fragments of it being described in the book. The standard library is included with all recent releases of CFEngine, and you can also obtain it from its [github repository](https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles), along with the rest of the CFEngine masterfiles framework. Also not listed are any files from the CFEngine source code distribution that are described in the book.

Click the icons above to download the entire collection. You can also browse or check out these files from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zzamboni/cf-learn.info/tree/master/static/src).
