## About CFEngine

[CFEngine](http://cfengine.com/) is the a mature and widely used tool
for configuration management. It was first released in 1993, and it
has evolved over the years to address real needs in real systems, and
to match technological developments such as virtualization and cloud
computing. CFEngine is fine-tuned to the features and design that make
it possible to automate very large numbers of systems in a scalable
and manageable way. CFEngine has been designed to be very
resource-efficient, and it can run on everything from embedded devices
and smartphones to supercomputers.

CFEngine 3 was released in 2008. With the new version came a complete
overhaul of its syntax and mode of operation, and many new features
such as Knowledge Management and support for virtual
environments. CFEngine 3 is **declarative** and **convergent**: you
specify the state in which you wish the system to be, and CFEngine
will automatically and iteratively decide the actions to take to reach
the desired state, or as close to it as possible. Underlying this
ability is a powerful theoretical model known as [Promise
Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_theory), which was
initially developed for CFEngine 3, but which has also found other
applications in Computer Science and in other fields such as Economics
and Organization.
