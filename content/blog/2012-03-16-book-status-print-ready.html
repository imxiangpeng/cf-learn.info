I am very happy! I got the notification today that the final book draft has been produced and sent to the printer. This means that over the next few days the final version will be available for purchase, both as e-book and in print form. I will of course let you know when this happens. <p></p> For now, time to enjoy a relaxing weekend, the first with no book-related work in a long time :)
