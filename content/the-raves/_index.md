Here are some of the nice things people have said about "Learning CFEngine 3" (since the O'Reilly Product Page for the book has disappeared, some of the links are to its last Wayback Machine archive snapshot). In most cases I have only included select quotes, you should follow the links to see the full review or comment.

> The book is excellent. It explains CFEngine 3 in a manner which is easy to understand. The examples are practical and can be adapted for production use at our site. After reading the book, the online documentation finally made sense.
>
> I know I will use the book as long as I manage CFEngine 3. It complements the online reference manuals perfectly. I also highly recommend the PDF version for quick browsing.

>
> Diego Zamboni delivers here on just 160 Pages, short and sharp, an intense introduction to CFEngine and the underlying "promise theory".

> I bought this book, and I saw the light! I've now read the book and I'm writing clean CFEngine recipes with the feeling of doing a good job, which won't block me in the future.

> This _is_ the book about CFEngine 3. Start with this one if you want to commit to the real CFEngine philosophy, the productive and clean one.

> ... something happened, and things changed like when the night turns into a new day.
>
> When the early release of "Learning cfengine 3" was announced, I think I was one of the first people who bought it. I started reading it, and it was amazing: **all the things that were confusingly buzzing in my head started to line themselves orderly**. In a very little time, I was able to do much more than I had been able to do in months. And I finally could appreciate the good qualities of cfengine I liked from version 2: powerful, predictable, lightweight.

> ... this book looks great. It explains the terminology of CFEngine very well. I've used CFEngine 2 for several years, but the change to version 3 had a large learning curve. This book definitely helped to lessen the curve and help me to develop new promises quickly. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn CFEngine 3.
