<div>I know, I <u><b>know</b></u>. It’s been over two years since the last post, and other than my occasional comment on the IRC channel or mailing list, you couldn’t be blamed to think that I had disappeared from the face of the earth.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But I’m back! And I have a few updates for you:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>I am finally working again on the new release of the book! It will focus on the upcoming CFEngine 3.7 release, and will of course also talk about all the goodies that were introduced in the 3.6 series.</li>
<li>You may notice the new, redesigned website. Most of the contents is the same as before, but the website is now being powered by my own <a href='https://github.com/zzamboni/enwrite'>Enwrite</a>, which allows me to post and manage contents from Evernote, making it much easier to keep things up to date. Please let me know if you find anything broken.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have a few other surprises coming up, but those are the big two for now. Follow <a href='https://twitter.com/learningcf3'>@LearningCF3</a> on Twitter if you want to stay updated.</div>
