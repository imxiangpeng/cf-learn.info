I am happy to announce that the new version of "Learning CFEngine" is now available! It's been a long time coming, but it's finally here. Among many other changes, the book has been updated to cover CFEngine 3.12 LTS.

You can get it right now at <https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/>, or by clicking on the box to the right.

Some other changes you may notice:

-   The name of the book has changed to "Learning CFEngine" instead of "Learning CFEngine 3". At the time of its first publication, CFEngine 3 was relatively new, but by now I feel it is no longer necessary to specify the version.
-   The cover is also new! I will write more about it in the future.
-   The book is now published via LeanPub, which makes the publishing process extremely easy, so I expect to make new releases much more frequently than before. You can purchase the book now, and get free updates as I release them.

I really hope you like this new release, and would very much welcome your feedback! Feel free to use the [Email the Author](https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/email%5Fauthor/new) form or the [Learning CFEngine Forum](https://community.leanpub.com/c/learning-cfengi).
