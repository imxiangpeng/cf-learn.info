- The book is no longer published by O'Reilly Media - the new release
  is published directly by me, and distributed through Amazon as a
  Kindle ebook, available now (see link on the right). It is also
  available at a lower price (US$9.99) than the O'Reilly release.

- The book now has an index! This has been a very frequent request
  since the book was first released.

- The book will also be available for free in this website! Over the
  next few weeks, I will publish it one chapter at a time.

- This release is still focused on CFEngine 3.5.2 (just like the last
  O'Reilly release), but being self-published, it will receive much
  more frequent updates as I update it for the most recent releases of
  CFEngine.

You can get the new release from Amazon immediately (disclaimer:

## Long version

Read on if you want the full, juicy details about the new release and
the change of publisher.

Over the last few years, O'Reilly has shifted its focus from being
primarily a book publisher, to being a much more diverse media
publisher -- its conferences, videos, tutorials, etc. have become just
as important, if not more, than its books. The change was made
official when O'Reilly announced that it was [stopping the direct
distribution of books, ebooks and
videos](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-mission-of-spreading-the-knowledge-of-innovators-continues),
but it's a shift many years in the making.

Since last year, O'Reilly decided they would no longer publish new
releases of "Learning CFEngine 3", but at my request, agreed to revert
the rights of the book back to me. This means that I can self-publish
the book, but I can no longer use the O'Reilly design elements,
including the animal in the cover (I consider the current cover to be
temporary, and am actively looking for a new cover design). However,
among other things, it also means that I can make the book's content
available for free, which is something I have wanted to do for a long
time. I have decided to make the full ebook available now, but over
the next few weeks, I will publish the chapters of the book in this
website. Stay tuned!

The departure from O'Reilly has been an extremely amicable
one. O'Reilly is an amazing publisher, and it was always a pleasure
working with them. I will always be particularly grateful to my
editor, [Andy Oram](https://www.oreilly.com/people/0221f-andy-oram),
who helped and supported me through the whole process, from the
initial conception of the book until the rights reassignment a few
weeks ago.

Why release the book now, before updating its contents to newer
versions of CFEngine? The most important reason is: to get it
out. I've been slowly working on updating the content, but I wanted to
get the self-publishing process done, and to make the index available,
which I think is a great resource for anyone reading the book. I have
also fixed many of the errata in the last release of the
book. Eventually I will produce a paperback version of the book, but
only after I update the contents. If you want a paper version of the
book, you can still get the O'Reilly release from Amazon and other
book vendors. If you are a [Safari Books
Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) subscriber, you can read
also [find it

I hope you enjoy this new release. I look forward to hearing from you!
