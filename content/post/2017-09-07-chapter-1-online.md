I have always believed that knowledge is best when freely shared. For
this reason I have for a long time wished I could make "Learning
CFEngine 3" freely available, and it became possible when the rights
of the book were reassigned to me. I am proud to announce that, as
promised [a few days ago]({{<relref
"/post/2017-08-30-new-release-of-learning-cfengine-3.md" >}}), the
first chapter of the book is now available online. Over the next few
weeks I will post the next chapters.

**Read it now at [The Book](/book).**
