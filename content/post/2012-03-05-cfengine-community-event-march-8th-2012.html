I am visiting the Bay Area this week, and we took the opportunity to organize a <a href="http://cfengine3paloalto.eventbrite.com/">CFEngine community event</a> on Thursday, March 8th, at 6:30 PM. Come by, meet the CFEngine team, hear about some of the exciting things we are working on, and give us your feedback for the future.<p></p>
<div>Hope to see you there! If you plan to attend please don't forget to <a href="http://cfengine3paloalto.eventbrite.com/">register</a>.</div>
