My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of [Learning CFEngine
3](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-cfengine-3/9781449334536/). I
am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall
geek, now turned manager, project lead and [SAFe Product
Owner](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/e6bf0ca2-f1c4-4af6-bf63-09f4b8cdbd02/public_url). I
am very interested in topics related to computer security,
virtualization, configuration management and system
automation. Currently I work at [Swisscom](http://swisscom.com/) in
the Cloud Development Platform team, where I lead teams working on
Health Management, Logging and Monitoring capabilities.


During college I founded the first computer security team at UNAM
(Mexico's national university), which would grow to become [a much
larger organization](http://www.seguridad.unam.mx/), before moving to
the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [Purdue
University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of
[Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my
studies, my wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked as
a researcher in computer security at the [IBM Zurich Research
Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). After eight years there, we moved
back to Mexico in late 2009, where I worked for HP Enterprise Services
as a security consultant. Afterwards I worked for a while at [CFEngine
AS](http://cfengine.com/), where my role was to advocate the power and
usefulness of CFEngine and lead the product development. I am now back
in Switzerland, where I live in
[Ittigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ittigen) with my awesome wife
and our two beautiful daughters.
