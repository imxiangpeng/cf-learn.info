My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of [Learning CFEngine](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-cfengine-3/9781449334536/). I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall geek, now turned manager, project lead and [SAFe Product Owner](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/e6bf0ca2-f1c4-4af6-bf63-09f4b8cdbd02/public%5Furl). I am very interested in topics related to computer security, virtualization, configuration management and system automation. Currently I work at [Swisscom](http://swisscom.com/) in the Cloud Development Platform team, where I lead teams working on Health Management, Logging and Monitoring capabilities.

During college I founded the first computer security team at UNAM (Mexico's national university), which would grow to become [a much larger organization](http://www.seguridad.unam.mx/), before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D.Â at [Purdue University](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of [Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my studies, my wife and I decided to go to Switzerland, where I worked as a researcher in computer security at the [IBM Zurich Research Lab](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/). After eight years there, we moved back to Mexico in late 2009, where I worked for HP Enterprise Services as a security consultant. Afterwards I worked for a while at [CFEngine AS](http://cfengine.com/), where my role was to advocate the power and usefulness of CFEngine and lead the product development. I am now back in Switzerland, where I live in [Ittigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ittigen) with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.
