My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of [Learning CFEngine](https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine). I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall geek. I am passionate about computer security, monitoring, virtualization, configuration management and system automation. Currently I work at [Swisscom](https://swisscom.com/) as Enterprise Security Architect.

During college I founded the [first computer security team at UNAM](https://web.archive.org/web/19981202131242/https://www.asc.unam.mx/) (Mexico's national university), which has grown to become [a much larger organization](https://www.seguridad.unam.mx/), before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D.Â at [Purdue University](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) under the direction of [Gene Spafford](https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/). Upon finishing my studies I moved to Switzerland, where I worked as a researcher in computer security at the [IBM Zurich Research Lab](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/). After eight years there I moved back to Mexico, where I worked for [HP Enterprise Services](https://www.hpe.com/) as a security consultant. Afterwards I worked at [CFEngine AS](https://cfengine.com/), where I took the role of educator, advocate and language product owner. I am now back in Switzerland, where I live with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.
