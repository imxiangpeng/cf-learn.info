A new version of the book has now been published, you can find it (including some free sample chapters) at <https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/>.

To avoid confusion, I have removed the old chapters which were available here---please get the latest version of the book to ensure you have up-to-date content.

Your support will help me continue working on future versions of this book (and [others](https://leanpub.com/learning-hammerspoon/)!) and on making more content available for free on this website. Thank you!
