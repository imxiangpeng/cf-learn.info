<div>I know, I <u><b>know</b></u>. It’s been over two years since the last post, and other than my occasional comment on the IRC channel or mailing list, you couldn’t be blamed to think that I had disappeared from the face of the earth.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But I’m back! And I have a few updates for you:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>I am finally working again on the new release of the book! It will focus on the upcoming CFEngine 3.7 release, and will of course also talk about all the goodies that were introduced in the 3.6 series.</li>
<li>You may notice the new, redesigned website. Most of the contents is the same as before, but the website is now being powered by my own <a href='https://github.com/zzamboni/enwrite'>Enwrite</a>, which allows me to post and manage contents from Evernote, making it much easier to keep things up to date. Please let me know if you find anything broken.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have a few other surprises coming up, but those are the big two for now. Follow <a href='https://twitter.com/learningcf3'>@LearningCF3</a> on Twitter if you want to stay updated.</div>

      </span>
      <p>My apologies for the long delay since the last tip! Today we come back with a simple tip: how to bootstrap a CFEngine client.</p>

<h2>First, some background</h2>

<p>CFEngine is designed to operate in a fully distributed fashion – each CFEngine client (i.e. a machine running <code>cf-agent</code>) can operate fully autonomously, using only the policy files stored locally. For regular operation, <code>cf-agent</code> does not require any type of network connectivity.</p>

<p>In real deployments, of course, maintaining each machine’s policy independently would be impractical, so CFEngine has the concept of a <em>policy hub</em>. In CFEngine Community, the policy hub is simply a file server, a machine from which others can download policy files. This allows having a single point of distribution, so that changes made there can be distributed to a large number of clients. In CFEngine Enterprise, the hub has a more complex role, acting also as an aggregator of data from the clients, for the purposes of reporting and analysis.</p>

<p>All CFEngine clients will copy to their local <code>/var/cfengine/inputs/</code> directory the contents of <code>/var/cfengine/masterfiles/</code> in the policy hub, so that is where you should make any changes that you want distributed to all the machines.</p>

<h2>Bootstrapping</h2>

<p>When a new client is installed, it needs to be told which machine is the policy hub to which it should connect. This is done using the following command:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server=10.0.2.15</pre></div>
</div>


<p>You should, of course, replace 10.0.2.15 with the actual IP address of the hub to which you want to bootstrap. The first machine you install will be the policy hub itself, and it should bootstrap to itself. In this case, you have to use its own external IP address, and not “localhost” or 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>When you issue this command on the policy hub, you will see a message like this, that indicates the host recognizes itself as a policy hub:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server=10.0.2.15

R:  -&gt; Started the server
R:  -&gt; Started the scheduler
-&gt; Bootstrap to 10.0.2.15 completed successfully</pre></div>
</div>


<p>If you issue it on a client, you will see a similar message, but indicating that it is bootstrapping from a different machine.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you use, after bootstrap you should see <code>/var/cfengine/inputs/</code> populated with the default set of policy files, and both <code>cf-execd</code> and <code>cf-serverd</code>  should be running:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># ps axw | grep [c]f-
16099 ?        Ss     0:00 /var/cfengine/bin/cf-execd
16102 ?        Ss     0:00 /var/cfengine/bin/cf-serverd</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Once this has been done, CFEngine will start running every 5 minutes, updating its policy files from the hub, and executing them afterwards.</p>

      <p>This is an extract from Chapter 3 of "Learning CFEngine 3", where you can also find a much more comprehensive description of bodies and bundles in the CFEngine 3 policy language.</p>
<p>The distinction between bundles and bodies can be confusing at first. Remembering these points may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bodies are named groups of attributes, whereas bundles are collections of promises. Promises are the units that actually do something in CFEngine (for example, run a command or add a line to a file), whereas attributes specify characteristics of how things are done (for example, whether to run the command in a shell, or where in the file to add the line).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of an attribute can be a basic data type (string, integer, list, etc.), it can be the name of a body, or it can be the name of a bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type of an attribute’s value is fixed, and determined by the attribute itself (for example, the value of the depth_search attribute in a files: promise is always a body, and the value of an edit_line attribute is always a bundle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For bodies and bundles, their type is always the name of the attribute to which they correspond. For example, bodies to be used with the depth_search attribute are always declared as “body depth_search xyz”, where xyz is an arbitrary name of your choosing. The same goes for bundles: bundles to be used with the edit_line attribute are always declared as “bundle edit_line xyz".</p>
<p>There are only four types of “top level” bundles that are not used as arguments to attributes: agent, server, knowledge and monitor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The promise types (sections) that can appear in a bundle are determined by the bundle type. For example, commands: promises can only appear in bundles of type agent. </p>
</li>
</ul>

      </span>
      <p>(This tip is based on a section from Chapter 5 of Learning CFEngine 3.)</p>

<p>Many system configuration tasks require groups of name-value pairs as arguments. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Editing configuration files in which parameters and their values need to be stored (ssh configuration files, Windows-style INI files, etc.)</li>
<li>Setting user parameters. In this case, sets of name-value pairs (home directory, full name, shell, etc.) are associated with a single user, identified by name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having sets of related values in a single array has a number of advantages, since they can be manipulated by a single set of promises just by varying the indices used to access them. To make use of this array, you have to pass it as an argument to a bundle. One of the most useful functions in this technique is <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/getindices">getindices()</a>, which returns a list containing the indices of the given array, and can be used to produce an enumeration of the elements over which to iterate. The complementary function to get just the values is <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/getvalues">getvalues()</a>. For example, consider <a href="http://cf-learn.info/code/ch04/configfiles2.cf.html">this bundle</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 2605453 arguments1.cf %}</p>

<p>To pass arrays as arguments we must pass a string with the name of the array, and then dereference it inside the function. The argument we are passing to set_config_values() is “configfiles.sshd”, which refers to the sshd array defined in the configfiles() bundle.  The dereferencing happens in the <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/copbl/blob/master/cfengine_stdlib.cf#L278">set_config_values() bundle</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 2605453 set_config_values.cf %}</p>

<p>This bundle receives the name of the array as the “v” parameter, so we dereference the array and its values by using <code>$(v)</code> wherever we would normally use the array name. For example, to loop over the array elements using the indices stored in the <code>$(index)</code> list, we use <code>$($(v)[$(index)])</code> instead of <code>$(configfiles.sshd[$(index)])</code>.</p>

<p>To group name/value sets into named groups, we can use two-dimensional arrays, as in <a href="http://cf-learn.info/code/ch04/users_use.cf.html">this example</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 2605453 users_use.cf %}</p>

<p>In this case the dereferencing can get a little more complicated. For example, let us look at some of the code inside the <a href="http://cf-learn.info/code/ch04/sys_create_users.cf.html">create_users() bundle</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 2605453 sys_create_users.cf %}</p>

<p>This bundle is being called from the methods: section of the <code>manage_users()</code> bundle, with the string <code>"manage_users.users"</code> as the value of <code>$(info)</code>. We use getindices() directly on this value to get a list of the first-level indices of the array (the user names), which we store in <code>@(user)</code>. Then we use implicit looping over <code>@(user)</code> to cycle through all those values, and we use the following construction to access individual elements of each user’s data: <code>$($(info)[$(user)][field])</code>. This expands to <code>$(manage_users.users[$(user)][field])</code>, on which implicit looping is applied through the <code>$(user)</code> variable. Remember that parenthesis (or curly braces, they mean the same) are required around the whole expression, so that CFEngine recognizes it properly as a variable reference.</p>

<p>While the syntax looks complicated, this data structure allows great flexibility in passing around and using data structures to be used in configuration operations.</p>

      There will be several CFEngine-related classes and talks at the <a href="http://www.picconf.org/">PICC'12 conference</a> (Professional IT Community Conference) on May 11-12th, in New Jersey. I will be talking about using CFEngine as part of your security infrastructure. My colleague Joe Netzel will be talking about migration from CFEngine 2 to CFEngine 3, so if you are using CF2 and have been considering (or dreading) the migration, make sure to come by! Aleksey Tsalolikhin will give an introductory class to CFEngine. And Mark Burgess will give a class not related to CFEngine, but to the perils and skills needed to survive as a technical person in the "business world".<p></p>
<div>If you are coming to the conference, we look forward to seeing you there!<br><ul>
