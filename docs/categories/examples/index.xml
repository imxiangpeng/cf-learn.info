      <description>I&#39;m happy to announce that the code examples from Learning CFEngine 3 are now available for browsing and download at http://cf-learn.info/code.html. You can view or download individual files, and also the whole collection. You can also get them from the GitHub repository. 
These examples are extracted automatically from the source files for the book, and as such reflect exactly the current state of what you will find in it. This also means, of course, that as the book evolves you will see changes in the files.</description>
