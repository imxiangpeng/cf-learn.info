      <description>This is an extract from Chapter 3 of &#34;Learning CFEngine 3&#34;, where you can also find a much more comprehensive description of bodies and bundles in the CFEngine 3 policy language.
The distinction between bundles and bodies can be confusing at first. Remembering these points may help:
  Bodies are named groups of attributes, whereas bundles are collections of promises. Promises are the units that actually do something in CFEngine (for example, run a command or add a line to a file), whereas attributes specify characteristics of how things are done (for example, whether to run the command in a shell, or where in the file to add the line).</description>
