      <description>Today, May 4th, 2012, O&#39;Reilly Media is participating in support of the FSF&#39;s Day Against DRM. All O&#39;Reilly ebooks and videos are DRM-free, and to celebrate this, you can get 50% off on any purchase by using the code DRMFREE.

I&#39;m proud to participate. Learning CFEngine 3 is also available as a DRM-free ebook, and you can use this code to get it at half price.

      <description>There will be several CFEngine-related classes and talks at the PICC&#39;12 conference (Professional IT Community Conference) on May 11-12th, in New Jersey. I will be talking about using CFEngine as part of your security infrastructure. My colleague Joe Netzel will be talking about migration from CFEngine 2 to CFEngine 3, so if you are using CF2 and have been considering (or dreading) the migration, make sure to come by! Aleksey Tsalolikhin will give an introductory class to CFEngine.</description>

      <description>I am ecstatic to announce that the book is now officially released! You can get it here: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do. If you purchased the Early Release version, you should automatically be able to download the final version from your &#34;Your products&#34; page at oreilly.com.
It&#39;s been an incredible ride, and it&#39;s an incredible feeling to see it come to this big milestone (I won&#39;t say &#34;the end&#34;, because I know this book will keep evolving).</description>

      <description>I am very happy! I got the notification today that the final book draft has been produced and sent to the printer. This means that over the next few days the final version will be available for purchase, both as e-book and in print form. I will of course let you know when this happens. 
For now, time to enjoy a relaxing weekend, the first with no book-related work in a long time :) </description>

      <title>Book status: production</title>

      <description>Some people have asked me what the status of the book is, so I thought I would post it here. The book is currently in the &#34;production stage&#34;, which means that the draft has been finalized content-wise, and is now being prepared for publication by O&#39;Reilly. They have a specialized group of people for this, who work on preparing nice final versions of the figures, making sure the layout of the book is correct, and doing a few thorough proofreading and editing passes.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m happy to announce that the code examples from Learning CFEngine 3 are now available for browsing and download at http://cf-learn.info/code.html. You can view or download individual files, and also the whole collection. You can also get them from the GitHub repository. 
These examples are extracted automatically from the source files for the book, and as such reflect exactly the current state of what you will find in it. This also means, of course, that as the book evolves you will see changes in the files.</description>
