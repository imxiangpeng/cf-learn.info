      <description>I know, I know. It’s been over two years since the last post, and other than my occasional comment on the IRC channel or mailing list, you couldn’t be blamed to think that I had disappeared from the face of the earth.  But I’m back! And I have a few updates for you:   I am finally working again on the new release of the book! It will focus on the upcoming CFEngine 3.</description>
