      <description>My apologies for the long delay since the last tip! Today we come back with a simple tip: how to bootstrap a CFEngine client.
First, some background CFEngine is designed to operate in a fully distributed fashion – each CFEngine client (i.e. a machine running cf-agent) can operate fully autonomously, using only the policy files stored locally. For regular operation, cf-agent does not require any type of network connectivity.
In real deployments, of course, maintaining each machine’s policy independently would be impractical, so CFEngine has the concept of a policy hub.</description>
