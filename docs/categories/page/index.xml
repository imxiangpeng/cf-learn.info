      <description>My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of Learning CFEngine 3. I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall geek, now turned manager. I am very interested in topics related to computer security, virtualization, configuration management and system automation. Currently I work at Swisscom in the Cloud Development Platform team, where I lead teams working on Health Management, Logging and Monitoring capabilities.
During college I founded the first computer security team at UNAM (Mexico&amp;rsquo;s national university), which would grow to become a much larger organization, before moving to the U.</description>

      <description>These are all the source files included in the book, organized by chapter. Note that in the text, many examples show only fragments of a larger file (for example, when things are explained step by step). In these cases, only the complete file is linked here, and only once per chapter.
Note that the CFEngine Standard Library is not included here, despite several fragments of it being described in the book.</description>

      <description>Here are some of the nice things people have said about &amp;ldquo;Learning CFEngine 3&amp;rdquo; (since the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Product Page for the book has disappeared, some of the links are to its last Wayback Machine archive snapshot). In most cases I have only included select quotes, you should follow the links to see the full review or comment.
 The book is excellent. It explains CFEngine 3 in a manner which is easy to understand.</description>

      <description>CFEngine 3 is a mature and widely used tool for configuration management, and Learning CFEngine 3will help you get up to speed with it.
The main audience for this book is experienced system administrators of none-to-medium expertise with CFEngine, but more advanced CFEngine users will also find useful snippets and techniques. Its goal is to guide you from installation to advanced examples and concepts by using examples and techniques that can be put to work straight away.</description>
